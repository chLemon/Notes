# 第一章 句子的形成

## 第一节 可以做主语的词类

+ 动名词做主语会形成主语太长的现象。用形式主语。动名词移动至句尾时，通常改为不定式短语

> Collecting stamps is one of his hobbies.
>
> It is one of his hobbies to collect stamps.

+ use的一些用法例外

> It is no use + doing
>
> It is useless to do
>
> It is of no use to do
>
> There is no use in doing

> It is useless to cry over split milk.
>
> It is of no use to cry over split milk.
>
> There is no use in crying over split milk.
>
> It is no use crying over split milk.

+ that从句不作介词的宾语
+ 以下情况则为惯用语

> in that = because 因为
>
> except that 只可惜，除了……
>
> notwithstanding that 尽管

+ 宾语从句中的may会改为be likely to，can改成be able to

## 第二节 动词的种类及其用法

+ feel like doing = would like to do 想做什么
+ look的一些短语

> look into = investigate 调查
>
> look over = examine 检查
>
> look at = watch 看

+ 上述的短语在句子中，副词经常会放到介词前面

> He looked happily at me.
>
> He looked carefully into the case.

+ resist doing 抗拒   refuse to do 拒绝
+ expect to do 期望…… = anticipate doing
+ stop doing = quit doing = cease doing/to do 停止做什么
+ stop to do停下来去做
+ whether引导宾语从句的时候，可以换成if

> I don't know if the typhoon will come.

+ 但是如果是主语从句、介词后的宾语、或者表语，就不行
+ for是替谁代劳的意思

> I took a picture of him. 照片里有他。
>
> I took a picture for him. 替他来照相。
